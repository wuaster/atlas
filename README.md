We want to allow users the option to offset their carbon emissions by donating money saved to charities like: TreeCanada, Arbor Day Foundation, Charity: Water. For the purpose of the hackathon, we are focusing on carbon emissions that were theoretically generated during travel. There is going to be a chatbot that asks you what kind of commute. Itll branch off into other questions. At the end, you will see a number of co2 emissions you saved and how much money you can give back to offset

# Features
